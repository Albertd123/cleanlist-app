üì± Option 1: Local Network Access (Best for Development)
If you're running the app locally on your computer:

Run the app with network access Use this command in your terminal:

bash
streamlit run your_app.py --server.address=0.0.0.0 --server.port=8501
Find your computer‚Äôs local IP address On Mac/Linux:

bash
ifconfig
On Windows:

bash
ipconfig
Look for something like 192.168.x.x.

Connect from your phone On the same Wi-Fi network, open your phone‚Äôs browser and go to:

Code
http://192.168.x.x:8501
Allow firewall access If prompted, allow Streamlit through your firewall so your phone can reach it.

üåê Option 2: Deploy to the Web
If you want to test from anywhere:

Use Streamlit Community Cloud Upload your app to GitHub and deploy it at streamlit.io. You‚Äôll get a public URL you can open on your phone.

Use platforms like Render, Heroku, or Hugging Face Spaces These also support Streamlit and give you mobile-accessible URLs.

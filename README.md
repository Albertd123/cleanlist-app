üì± Option 1: Local Network Access (Best for Development)

If you're running the app locally on your computer:



Run the app with network access Use this command in your terminal:



bash

streamlit run your\_app.py --server.address=0.0.0.0 --server.port=8501

Find your computer‚Äôs local IP address On Mac/Linux:



bash

ifconfig

On Windows:



bash

ipconfig

Look for something like 192.168.x.x.



Connect from your phone On the same Wi-Fi network, open your phone‚Äôs browser and go to:



Code

http://192.168.x.x:8501

Allow firewall access If prompted, allow Streamlit through your firewall so your phone can reach it.



üåê Option 2: Deploy to the Web

If you want to test from anywhere:



Use Streamlit Community Cloud Upload your app to GitHub and deploy it at streamlit.io. You‚Äôll get a public URL you can open on your phone.



Use platforms like Render, Heroku, or Hugging Face Spaces These also support Streamlit and give you mobile-accessible URLs.
